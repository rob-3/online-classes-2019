## Consumer surplus
- Value the consumer gains
- Difference between the price a consumer would pay for something and the price
  they paid for it
- Represented by the area between the price level and the demand curve

## Producer Surplus
- Value the producer gains
- Difference between the price a producer would sell something and the price
  they actually sold it for
- Represented by the area between the price level and the supply curve

## Economic surplus
- Wealth created is maximized when the price is at the equilibrium price
- Economic surplus = producer surplus + consumer surplus

## Deadweight losses
- Wealth lost due to the price not being at the equilibrium price

## Allocative efficiency
- Marginal benefit = marginal cost
- Economic surplus maximized
- Resources are being allocated to the correct things
- It is difficult for governments or non market organizations to achieve this

## Price Ceilings
- Some consumers benefit from lower prices
- Some consumers are worse off and don't get the product
- Suppliers get less and are worse off
- Society as a whole is worse off

## Price Floors
- Some producers benefit from better prices
- Some producers lose business and don't get to sell
- Demanders are worse off due to higher prices and less availability
- Society is worse off

## Excise Taxes
- 2 prices in market, amount paid by demanders and amount received by suppliers
- Tax = difference in these prices
- As a result, quantity supplied is reduced
- Govt recovers a good chunk of this via the tax
- Consumers and producers both lose out
- Govt wins
- Overall, society is worse off

## Math and efficiency
- Area equals the amount of welfare

# Lecture

## Deadweight loss
- The amount of economic surplus forgone when a market is not allowed to reach
  equilibrium

## Productive efficiency
- Producing output at the lowest possible average cost of production

## Allocative efficiency
- Producing the g&s that are most wanted by consumers
- MB = MC for all products if this is achieved

## Price Ceilings
- Producer surplus is reduced
- Consumer surplus may increase/decrease, but there are clear winners and losers
- Deadweight loss occurs

## Price Floors
- Consumer surplus is reduced
- Producer surplus may increase/decrease, but there are clear winners and losers
- Deadweight loss occurs

## Taxes
- All consumers and producers lose
- Govt wins
- Smaller deadweight loss than pure price floor/ceiling
