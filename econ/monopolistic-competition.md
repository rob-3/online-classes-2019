# Monopolistic Competition
- Large # of sellers
- Some control of price
- Relatively easy entry/exit
- Nonprice differentiation to help firms compete
- There is availability of close substitutes

## Short Run Equilibrium
- Still will sell at marginal revenue = marginal cost
- Looks similar to monopoly, but more elastic and smaller economic profits
- Normal profits in the long run
- No allocative/productive efficiency

# Oligopoly
- Only a few large sellers
- Could be standardized or differentiated products
- **Entry barriers**
- Price makers
- Not productive efficiency or allocative efficiency

# Cartels
- Collude to hold up prices

## Game Theory
- Payoff Matrix: a table showing the outcomes depending on decisions
	- Dominant strategy: a strategy that secures the highest payoffs regardless
	  of the activity of others
- Nash Equilibrium: neither party can improve its outcome unless they collude
