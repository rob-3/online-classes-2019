- Explicit costs = monetary payments made to ensure a business can function
	- Wages
	- Resources purchased
	- Rent
- Implicit costs = op costs of ownde resources
	- Op costs of land
	- Savings: you lose interest
- Economics costs = explicit costs + implicit costs

## Accounting
- Accounting profit = total revenue - explicit costs
- Economic profit = total revenue - economic costs
- Positive economic profit means that you are doing that much better than the
  next best alternative

## Short run relationships
- Total product (TP) = total output
- Marginal product (MP) = Δtotal product/Δlabor
- Average product (AP) = total product/labor
- Increasing marginal returns: increase in productivity
- Diminishing marginal returns
- At least 1 factor of production cannot be changed

## Costs
- Fixed costs: constant with Δproduction
	- Ex: rent
- Variable costs: change with Δoutput
	- Ex: labor, resources
- Total costs = fixed costs + variable costs

## Average costs
- Average fixed cost = total fixed cost/output
- Average variable cost = total variable cost/output
- Average total cost = total cost/output or average fixed cost + average
  variable cost
- First decreases, then increases

## Marginal costs
- MC = Δtotal cost/Δoutput or Δtotal variable cost/Δoutput
- First decreases, then increases
- When marginal cost is greater than average cost, then average cost will rise.
- When marginal cost is less than average cost, then average cost will fall.
- When marginal cost = average cost, then average cost will not change.

## The Long Run
- Firms can now change buildings more easily and expand or contract
- Different size plants can be optimal for different levels of production.
- With infinite plant sizes, the long run average cost curve is generally a
  parabola with negative *a*

## Long-run relationships
- Economies of scale: falling average total costs with rising output
- Minimum efficiency scale: minimum ouput to reach lowest possible ATC
- Constant returns to scale: no more efficiency gains
- Diseconomies of scale: efficiency drops with greater size of output
