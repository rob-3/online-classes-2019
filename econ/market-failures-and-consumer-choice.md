# Lecture: Market Failures
- Externality: the benefit enjoyed by or cost imposed on a third part not
  directly involved in the production or consumption of a good or service.

- Private market: a market in which the demand and supply curve represent the
  benefits and costs to only the consumers and producers in the market.

- External marginal cost: the cost of an additional unit of a good or service
  that is imposed on people other than the producer
  - Ex: pollution

- Social marginal cost: the cost to society of producing an additional unit of a
  good or service

- External marginal benefit: the benefit of an additional unit of a good or service
  that is enjoyed by people other than the direct consumer of the good or
  service
  - Ex: dressing up nicely

- Social marginal benefit: the benefit to society of consuming an additional unit of a
  good or service

## Positive Externality
- The unpaid benefit enjoyed by a third party not directly involved in the
  production or consumption of a good or service
- Private demand: considers direct benefits to the private party
- Social demand: considers all benefits to society
- Private supply: considers direct costs on the private supplier
- Social supply: considers all cost on society

## Public Goods
- Any good or service that is both nonrival and nonexcludable
- Nonrival: consumption of the good doesn't diminish the amount available to
  another person
- Nonexcludable: people cannot be easily prevented from consuming the good or
  service, even if they don't pay for it

# Lecture: Consumer Choice
- Utility: utils or dollars = the amount of satisfaction or happiness received
  from the consumption of goods and services
- Utils: subjective measure of the utility associated with consuming a good or
  service

## Marginal Utility
- Additional satisfaction or happiness received from the consumption of a good
  or service
- Total utility: sum of the marginal utilities

## Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility
- Marginal Utility decreases with each additional unit consumed

## Utility Maximization
- The process of obtaining the greatest level of overall satisfaction or
  happiness from consuming goods and services, subject to consumers'
  preferences, incomes, and prices
- 4 assumptions:
	- Rational behavior
	- Ranked preferences
	- Limited income
	- Prices

## Equal Marginal Principle
- The idea that consumers maximize their utility when they allocate their
  limited incomes so that the marginal utility per dollar spent on each of their
  final choices in a bundle is equal.
- MUa/Pa = MUb/Pb
