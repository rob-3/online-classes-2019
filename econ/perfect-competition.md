# Perfect Competition
- Large number of sellers
- Standardized product: the product is effectively the same across sellers
- Price takers: they must take the market price
- Easy entry and exit

# Price takers
- Firms that accept the market price and cannot influence market price
- Price/marginal revenue is equal to the market price, and is constant
- Produce until marginal costs equal price/marginal revenue.

# Economic profit
- Level of profit that occurs when total revenue is greater than total costs

# Normal profit
- Level of profit that occurs when economic profits are 0

# Economic loss
- Still making an accounting profit, but economic profits are below 0
- Might still make sense to continue operation and hope for rising prices

+ A firm should shutdown at the shutdown point, where price < AVC.

+ Supply curve is the marginal cost curve in the short run above the shutdown
  point

# The Long Run
- If the price is above the average total cost, then more firms will enter and
  lower the price
- If the price is below the average total cost, then firms experiencing economic
  losses will leave the market, raising the price again

# Industry types
- Constant-cost industry: long-run supply curve is a horizontal line since costs
  of production don't change with change in output
- Increasing-cost industry: long-run supply curve slopes upward and costs of
  production rise with expanded output
- Decreasing-cost industry: long-run supply curve slopes downward, with falling
  costs of production with expanded output
