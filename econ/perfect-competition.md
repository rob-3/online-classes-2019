# Perfect Competition
- Large number of sellers
- Standardized product: the product is effectively the same across sellers
- Price takers: they must take the market price
- Easy entry and exit

# Price takers
- Firms that accept the market price and cannot influence market price
- Price/marginal revenue is equal to the market price, and is constant
