# Pure Monopoly
- Single seller
- No close substitutes
- Price maker
- Barriers to enter market

Monopoly power: can set prices via changing quantities produced

# Marginal Revenue under a Pure Monopoly
- Always falls below the demand curve
- This is because the only way to sell more is to lower prices, which will lose
  money on all previous units.

# Monopolies
- Monopolies can raise prices to whatever consumers are willing to pay. However,
  this doesn't guarantee that the monopoly will make profit. ATC could still be
  higher than the price consumers are willing to pay.

- Monopolies aren't usually productively efficient because they don't have to be.

- Monopolies create deadweight loss due to their underproduction

# First-Degree Price Discrimination
- The practice of charging each consumer the price they are willing to pay
- Possibly in a monopoly because they are the only provider

# Second-Degree Price Discrimination
- Selling better unit rates in big packs
- Pencils (better unit rate) but you don't need a bunch

# Third-Degree Price Discrimination
- Dividing the market participants into different groups based on elasticity
- Ex: Charges different prices across the age groups

# Regulation

## Natural Monopoly
- An industry where economies of scale are so extensive that the market is
  better served by a single firm

## Unregulated Monopoly Price
- The profit-maximizing price that will result from an unregulated monopolistic
  market

## Normal Price Regulation
- Government grants monopoly and sets prices where profit will be normal profit
