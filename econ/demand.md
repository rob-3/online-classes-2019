# Prices
- Prices are controlled by producers and consumers
- Competition and "voting with the wallet" help keep prices low
- The producer's costs and profit margins keep prices high
- Interaction between supply and demand determines prices in a *marketplace*

# Demand
- Willingness: why buy a thing? 
- Ability to pay: can people actually afford it?
- **Law of Demand**: as price increases, demand decreases
- 3 things shape demand:
	- **Income effect**: lower prices increase purchases powers
	- **Diminishing Marginal Utility**: buying more of a thing reduces the
	  marginal utility, so the equilibrium shifts when price drops
	- **Substitution effect**: alternatives can replace demand for a product
- Market demand = sum of the individual demands of all markets
- Nonprice factors can shift the demand curve

# Determinants of Demand
- 2 types of goods:
	- Normal: more income, more demand (things like lobster)
		- Direct relationship
	- Inferior: more income, less demand (things like rice)
		- Inverse relationship
- Tastes and Preferences
	- Things go in and out of style, changing demand
- Number of buyers
	- More buyers = more demand
- Expectations about future events
	- If people think prices will rise, or that their incomes will drop, demand
	  will increase
	- Job security
	- Availability of goods
- Substitutes and Complements
	- Substitutes: goods that can easily take each other's place
		- Price hike in one will increase demand for the other
		- Inverse relationship
	- Complements: goods that are consumed together (PB and jelly)
		- Price hike in one will reduce demand for the other
		- Direct relationship

# Lecture
- Market: any place/mechanism where buyers and sellers interact to trade goods, services,
  or resource
- Trade occurs via interaction of buyers and sellers
- Prices are set via the interaction of buyers and sellers
	- **Greedy companies usually cannot just set prices at whatever level they like**
	- *In a competitive environment*
- *Law of Demand*: as price increases, quantity demanded goes down
- Demand curves are always continuous (even if the demand is discrete), and can
  be nonlinear (though often in examples for expedience) 

## Law of Demand
1) Income effect: Purchasing power rises/falls, so people will purchase more/less
2) Diminishing marginal utility: As people consume more, each additional unit
   provides less utility
3) Substitution effect: People will seek alternatives to a product if prices rise

- Market Demand: sum of all individual demands

## Change in Demand
- "Demand" refers to the curve; so amount demanded can change without "demand"
  changing
- Demand: as the price of something rises, the quantity demanded will decrease,
  *all else held constant*

## Why does demand change?
- Incomes rise or fall
- Other nonmoney factors

## Inferior goods
- A good for which there is an inverse relationship between the demand for the
  good and income
- People buy them when they have less money
- Opposite is the **normal good**

## Tastes of Preferences
- Things go in or out of style, increasing or decreasing demand

## Expectations
- Income: people might fear that the economy will crash and save money
- Availability: people might think that a good will become more difficult or
  impossible to obtain
- Future prices: if you think it will be more expensive in the future, buy now

## Substitutes
- If price of one good goes up, substitutes will experience increase in demand

## Complements
- Goods used together
- If price of one increases, it will cause demand for both to fall
