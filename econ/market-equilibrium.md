# Market Equilibrium
- Found at the intersection of the supply and demand curves
- In competitive markets, the equilibrium price will be reached given time
- Markets naturally adjust toward the equilibrium price and quantity
- Market "clears" aka demand = supply at the equilibrium point

# Disequilibriums
- Shortage: producers provide too little at the prevailing price
- Surplus: too much produced at the prevailing price

# Shifts in Equilibrium
- Upward demand shock: demand rises, which raises prices and production
- Downward demand shock: demand falls, which reduces prices and production
- Upward supply shock: supply rises, which reduces prices and increases
  production
- Downward supply shock: supply falls, which increases prices and decreases
  production

# More Complex Changes
- Demand and supply increase: quantity increases, price can go either way
	- Depends if demand increases more or if supply increases more
- Increase in demand, decrease in supply: prices will rise, quantity can go
  either way
...

# Market Distortions
- Price Ceilings: maximum legal price (usually set by govt)
	- Typically causes a shortage
- Price Floor: minimum legal price (usually set by govt)
	- Typically causes a surplus
- Tax on Suppliers:
	- Causes prices to rise and output to fall
	- Both suppliers and demanders pay
	- Creates a deadweight loss
- Tax on Demanders: sales tax
	- Prices fall and output falls
	- Both suppliers and demanders pay
	- Creates a deadweight loss

-------
- Neither sellers nor buyers set prices
- Interaction sets prices
- If prices are too high, then demand won't be enough for everyone to have
  business
- If prices are too low, then demand will be too high for suppliers to produce
  enough
- Thus, prices tend back toward equilibrium

# Price Ceiling
- Maximum legal price of a good or service
- Prevents the market from reaching an equilibrium price
- Creates a shortage
- Example: housing

# Price Floor
- Minimum legal price of a good or service
- Example: minimum wage
- Creates surplus

# Taxes

## Tax on Suppliers
- Quantity supplied decreases and listed prices increase (suppliers get less)
- **Both suppliers and demanders pay!**

## Tax on Demanders
- Quantity demanded and list prices drop (price + tax increases)
- **Both suppliers and demanders pay!**
