# Market Equilibrium
- Found at the intersection of the supply and demand curves
- In competitive markets, the equilibrium price will be reached given time
- Markets naturally adjust toward the equilibrium price and quantity
- Market "clears" aka demand = supply at the equilibrium point

# Disequilibriums
- Shortage: producers provide too little at the prevailing price
- Surplus: too much produced at the prevailing price

# Shifts in Equilibrium
- Upward demand shock: demand rises, which raises prices and production
- Downward demand shock: demand falls, which reduces prices and production
- Upward supply shock: supply rises, which reduces prices and increases
  production
- Downward supply shock: supply falls, which increases prices and decreases
  production

# More Complex Changes
- Demand and supply increase: quantity increases, price can go either way
	- Depends if demand increases more or if supply increases more
- Increase in demand, decrease in supply: prices will rise, quantity can go
  either way
...

# Market Distortions
- Price Ceilings: maximum legal price (usually set by govt)
	- Typically causes a shortage
- Price Floor: minimum legal price (usually set by govt)
	- Typically causes a surplus
- Tax on Suppliers:
	- Causes prices to rise and output to fall
	- Both suppliers and demanders pay
	- Creates a deadweight loss
- Tax on Demanders: sales tax
	- Prices fall and output falls
	- Both suppliers and demanders pay
	- Creates a deadweight loss
