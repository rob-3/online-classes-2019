- Elasticity: how responsive supply and demand are to price changes
- Elasticity = %ΔQs/%ΔP (suppliers) or %ΔQd/%ΔP (demanders)

## Elasticity in Demand
- Elasticity = percentage change in quantity/percentage change in price =>
  percentage
- Either can be negative
- Price elasticity of demand will always be negative!
	- This is due to the law of demand
- In context: if price decreases 1%, then the quantity demanded will increase Ed%

## Elasticity in Supply


# Lecture

## Calculating elasticity (basic approach)
- Percent change = (Qf - Q0) / Q0
- **It is not the same slope of the demand curve due to denominator**

## Midpoint Formula
- Use the midpoint as the denominator to normalize differences due to starting
  and ending location
- Using the midpoint formula, % change is equal increasing and decreasing
- (Qf - Q0) / ((Qf + Q0)/2)

## Elasticity of Demand
- Always negative, so we usually consider absolute value
- 3 possibilities
	1) Elastic: Ed > 1
	2) Inelastic: Ed < 1
	3) Unit-Elastic: Ed = 1
- When there is linear demand, at high prices demand is more elastic
- More elastic when more substitutes are available
- More elastic when the proportion of income is larger
	- Expensive stuff is hard to buy but people will jump for a good deal
- Luxury goods are very elastic, necessities are inelastic
- The more time given to adjust, the more elastic demand becomes.
	- It is difficult to find substitutes on short notice

## Total Revenue 
- TR = P * Q
- Does not represent profits, just revenue
- Opposite direction of price when elastic
- Follows direction of price when inelastic
- At unit elasticity TR is maximized

## Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand
- Measure of the effect of a change in the price of one product on the quantity
  demanded of another.
- CPE = %ΔQd/%ΔPa, where a and b are two different products
- Cross-price elasticity is > 0 for substitutes
- For complements, cross-price elasticity is < 0

## Income Elasticity of Demand
- A measure of how responsive demand is to a change in consumer income
- IED = %ΔQd/%ΔIncome
- Income elasticity is positive for normal goods and negative for inferior goods

## Price Elasticity of Supply
- %ΔQs/%ΔPrice
- Always positive due to the Law of Supply
- Midpoint can be used

### Elasticity over Time Periods
- Immediate Supply Curve is vertical: firms can't somehow change production
  immediately
- Short Run: At least one input of production is fixed, but other can be changed
  (commonly plant size, which is hard to suddenly expand)
	- Flatter than immediate
- Long Run: All inputs of production can be changed
	- Flattest of all
