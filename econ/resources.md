- Marginal revenue product (MRP) = Δ in total revenue / Δ in resource quantity

- 4 kinds of resource payment
	- Land: rent
	- Labor: wages
	- Capital: interest
	- Entrepreneurial ability: profits/losses
- Marginal resource cost (MRC) = Δ in total cost / Δ in resource quantity

- Derived demand: demand that is based on another demand
	- MRP is the demand for resources
	- MRP = MRC at the optimal resource utilization, because firms will purchase more resources that
	  improve revenue more than they cost

- 3 determinants of resource demand
	- Demand for good or service produced
	- Productivity
	- Price of other resources

- Demand for a substitute-resource moves in the same direction as the resource demand
- Demand for a complementary-resource moves in the opposite direction as the resource demand

- Wage determination is a function of prices and productivity of the worker

- Nominal wages: the raw dollar amount
- Real wages: the purchasing power of nominal wages

# Unions

## Inclusive Union
