- Symbolizing categorical logic

## Limitations of the Truth Table Test for Validity
- Take the following argument:
	- P1: All cats are animals
	- P2: All kittens are cats
	- C: All kittens are animals
- The truth table method would fail to assert that the argument was valid
- The problem: propositional logic's smallest unit is the simple statement, but
  some arguments can be centered around smaller parts
- Categorical logics allows for "classes" like "cats" or "animals" and allows
  them to be compared with "all", "no", and "some"

## Propositional Logic vs. Categorical Logic
- Categorical has classes as the fundamental elements
- Uses capital letters to represent classes
- Uses "all", "no", and "some" to relate classes
- Uses a Venn Diagram to test the validity of an argument

## Standard Form Categorical Propositions
- Categorical Propositions: propositions that relate two classes or categories
  by telling us that either all or part of the first class is included in or
  excluded from the second class
1) All S are P.
	- All of the S group is included in the P group
	- "All humans are animals"
2) No S are P.
	- All of the S group is excluded from the P group
	- "No humans are crabs"
3) Some S are P.
	- Some/part of the S group is included in the P group
	- "Some people are silly [people]"
4) Some S are not P.
	- Some of the S group are excluded from the P group
	- "Some people are not happy [people]"
- All categorical propositions can be put into one of these forms
- Classes cannot be simple adjectives, hence the brackets in the "some" examples
  above

### Not Categorical Propositions
- "All S are not P": **Not a standard form categorical proposition**
	- Could mean "No S are P"
		- All penguins are not lawyers
	- Could mean "Some S are not P"
	- All cats are not kittens
- "No S are not P"
	- No kittens are not cats
	- Basically means "All S are P"

### Parts of Categorical Propositions
- Subject class: the class represented by S (comes first in standard form)
	- Subject term: the name of the subject class
- Predicate class: The class represented by P (comes second)
	- Predicate term: the name of the predicate class
- Quanitifer: "all", "no", "some"
- Copula: the words "are" or "are not"

### Symbolizing Basic Categorical Propositions
1) Identify which std form you need and rewrite the proposition in that form.
2) Identify the classes and assign each a capital letter.
3) Rewrite the categorical proposition in std form
┌────────┐
│Examples│
└────────┘
All kittens are baby animals.
+ Form All S are P.
+ Rewrite: All kitten are baby animals.
+ K: kittens
+ B: baby animals
+ All K are B
Some people aren't wealthy.
+ Form: Some S are not P.
+ Rewrite: Some people are not wealthy people.
+ P: people
+ W: wealthy people
+ Some P are not W
