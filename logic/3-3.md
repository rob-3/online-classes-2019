# Inductive arguments
+ Deductive argument: attempts to show that the conclusion must be true if the premises are true
	- Mathmatical arguments
	- Definition words
	- Categorical and propositional logic
+ Inductive argument: attempts to show that the conclusion is **likely** if the premises are true
	- Predictions about future
	- Polls/sampling
	- Arguments from testimony (experts)
	- Causal Inferences
	- Arguments from Analogy
+ Strong inductive arguments: like validity for deductive arguments, it is improbably that the premises
  will be true and the conclusion false
	- Argument is weak if that is not the case
+ Cogency: like soundness for deductive arguments, the premises are true and the argument is strong

# Fallacies of Weak Induction
1) Appeal to Unqualified Authority
	- When someone biased or is otherwise an unqualified authority
2) Appeal to Ignorance
	- Premise: there is no proof that A is true/false -> A is false/true
3) Hasty Generalization
	- An unrepresentative sample is used to justify a generalization
4) False Cause
	- A poor conclusion that correlation implies causation.
	- Inverted cause-effect relationship
	- Ignoring other causes
5) Slippery Slope
	- An assertion that a small step will lead to a chain of related events to occur, culminating in an
	  otherwise implausible event
6) Weak Analogy
	- Because two things are similar, we should expect them to have further similarities
	- Often true, but irrelevant similarities or otherwise insufficient similarities do not prove
	  anything
