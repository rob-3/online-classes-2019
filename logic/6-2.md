# Propositional Logic: Review
- A way of mathematically modelling the logical structure of sentences and
  arguments that treats *simple statements* as the fundamental building blocks
  of *complex statements* and arguments.
- Last week we discussed symbolizing statements in prop logic.
- We used ~, ∙, ∨, ⊃, and ّ≡
- We will learn now how to use these symbols to build a truth table and
  calculate more complex truth values

# Truth Table
- An arrangement of truth values that shows in every possible case how the truth
  value of a compound proposition is determined by the truth values of its
  simple components
- We will be able to use a truth table to decide if arguments are valid or
  invalid

Ex: A truth table for ~P
  P    ~P
----------
  T |  F
  F |  T

# Solving a Truth Table
1) "Plug in" truth values
2) Work inside out and evaluate operators
3) When you have 1 remaining truth value, circle it.

# Main Operator
- The main operator has as its scope everything else in the statement
- The main operator captures the structure of the statement as a whole
- ~ is rarely the main operator unless everything else is in parentheses

Practice problems
-----------------
(A∙B)∨C for [A, B, C] = [T, F, T]
(T∙F)∨T
  F  ∨T
    *T*
