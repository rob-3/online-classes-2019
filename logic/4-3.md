## Propositional Logic vs Categorical Logic
- Propositional logic fundamental elements: simple statements
	- Uses logical operators to relate simple statements
	- Truth tables for validity test
- Categorical logic fundamental elements: classes
	- Uses the words "all", "no", and "some" to relate classes
	- Venn Diagrams for validity test

## Validity
- Way to determine what is and is not possible
- We need to represent the entire space of possibilities
- In categorical logic, we use venn diagrams to encompass all possibilities
- Numbers:
	1: represents a member of only S
	2: represents a member of both S and P
	3: represents a member of only P
	4: represents a member of neither S nor P

## Venn Diagrams
- A Shaded region indicates that nothing is there
- An "X" indicates that something is there

## How to use Venn Diagrams to Test for Validity
1) Rewrite, symbolize, and diagram the premise
2) Rewrite, symbolize, and diagram the conclusion (in a new diagram).
3) Ask if the information in the conclusion diagram is contained in the
premises.
