# Section 1.1: Arguments and their parts

## Logic: the organized body of knowledge that evaluates arguments
	- Formal logic: evaluates arguments using mathematical models and procedures
	- Informal logic: evaluates arguments without mathematical models and
	  procedures, bu identifying patterns in good or bad arguments

## Argument: a group of statements, one or more of which are claimed to provide
support for, or reasons to believe, one of the others

## Statements: a sentence that have a *truth value*

## Truth values: truth or falsity

> You are taking Introduction to Logic
> (should be true)

> the sun revolves around the Earth
> (should be false)

> Donald Trump is wearing a red tie today:
> (don't know, but does have a truth value)

## Not statements:
- Exclamation: "Great work!"
- Question: "Where are you?"
- Proposal: "Let's go to the party."

## Parts of arguments
- Premises: statement(s) that provide support
- Conclusions: supported statement

## Identifying conclusions
- Indicator words
- Often the first sentence in a long passage

## Identifying premises
- Indicator words
- Not the conclusions

## Premise-conclusion form
- Premises always are before the conclusion
- Conclusion is always last
- P1:, P2:, P3:... and C:
- Rewording is often necessary in order to eliminate irrelevant information

## Tips for premise-conclusion form
- Each statement (premise and conclusion) should be able to stand alone (no
  pronouns!)
- Remove irrelevant statements/nonstatements

# Section 1.4: Validity and Soundness

## Logic: the organized body of knowledge that evaluates arguments

## What makes arguments bad
- False premises: the premises simply aren't true
- Premises are unrelated to/do not support the conclusion
- These are the only two ways an argument can be bad

## Validity and invalidity
- Validity: an argument is valid if and only if the conclusion must be true
  given that the premises are true
- Alternate: an argument is valid if and only if it is impossible for the
  premises to be true and the conclusion false
- Invalid argument: an argument that is not valid
- **False premises can still lead to a valid argument**

## Showing that an argument is invalid
- Point out that the premises can be true and the conclusion false
- Draw the situation out and try to create a situation where the argument is
  invalid
- Imagine a minimal situation that meets the premises where the conclusion is
  not true

## Soundness and unsoundness
- Arguments are *sound* if and only if it is valid and has true premises
- Arguments are unsound if and only if it is not sound
