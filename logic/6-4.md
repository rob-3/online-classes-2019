# Review
- **Validity**: an argument is valid if and only if it is impossible for the
  premises to be true and the conclusion false
- An argument can be valid but still "bad", because it can be unsound
- **Soundness**: an argument is sound if and only if it is valid and has all
  true premises

## "The Imagination Test" for Validity
- Suppose the premises are true
- Can we imagine a situation in which the conclusion is false?
	- If so, the argument is invalid
	- If not, the argument may be valid: we might have made a mistake or
	  overlooked something
### Limitations
- We might overlook something
- It can be difficult to imagine complex situations with many or complex
  premises
- We can never prove that an argument is valid, only that it is invalid
- It's difficult to see any unifying patterns across valid or invalid arguments

## Using a Truth Table to Test Validity
1) Make a truth table, with a column for each premise and the conclusion
2) Look for a row where the premises are all true and that the conclusion is
   false.
3) If there is such a row, then the argument is invalid. Otherwise, it is valid.

### Advantages
- As long as the truth table is made correctly, we can be sure that an argument
  is either valid or invalid; we won't miss any possibilities
- Complexity is abstracted into letters and can be handled given enough time
  even for very complex argument
- Truth tables ultimately test an argument's structure, which can tell us
  universal truths about arguments of a given form
