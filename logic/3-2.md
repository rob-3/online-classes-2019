# Review: Formal and Informal Logic
- Formal: Uses mathematical models (truth tables/venn diagrams)
- Informal: Looks for patterns that are good and bad in arguments (no math)

## Validity
- The conclusion must be true if the premises are true

## Soundness
- Validity + premises are true

# Informal Logical Fallacies
- A type of informal logic that identifies common properties of bad arguments.
- A logical fallacy is an error in reasoning.
- Logical fallacies are like illusions: they can trick us into thinking bad
  arguments are good.
- Most undermine validity of the argument, but some undermine the truth of the
  premises.
- A fallacy can also be called a "non-sequitur" ("does not follow")

## Fallacies of Relevance
- Premises irrelevant to the conclusion

## Fallacies of Weak Induction
- Poorly built inductive arguments

## Fallacies of Presumption, Ambiguity, and Illicit Transference
- Circular
- Ambiguity that invalidates arguments
- Assuming something about the whole based on the parts

# Fallacies of Relevance

## Appeal to Force
- Attempt to persuade someone of the conclusion using threats
- Important that the person must believe something due to the threat
- "You had better support the new company policy if you expect to keep your
  job."

## Appeal to Pity
- Tries to invoke pity to persuade someone of a conclusion simply by evoking
  pity
- NOT a fallacy if there are concrete reasons that we should help or pity; this
  error is only valid if the sole reason for the conclusion is pity
- "How can you convict this man of murder? He's an orphan!"

## Appeal to the People
- Direct
	- A "mob mentality" idea that is based on emotions rather than logic
	- Often with a "magnetic" figure
- Indirect: "Bandwagon" argument
	- Because many people believe or do something, you should too.
	- Appeal to vanity: celebrity endorsement
	- Appeal to snobbery: cool/smart/elite/powerful people do something
	- Appeal to tradition: "we've always done it this way"

## Ad Hominem/"Against the person"
- Attacking the person or their character instead of the argument itself
- Claims that because someone is bad, their argument is invalid
- 3 kinds
	- Ad hominem abusive: criticizing a person rather than arguments
	- Ad hominem circumstantial: criticizes motives
	- Tu quoque "You too": a person is made to appear hypocritical for what they
	  are arguing

## Accident
- A general rule is applied to a specific case it wasn't intended to cover

## Straw Man
- Exaggerate the opponent's position and use the misrepresentation to claim that
  the original position is wrong.

## Missing the Point
- Premises support a conclusion, but the argument draws a different conclusion
  instead.
- Often the supported conclusion is a weaker version of the asserted conclusion.

## Red Herring
- A subtle shift in subject matter
- 2 types
	- Distracts listeners from an argument the opponent has made
	- Provides premises and draws another conclusion, unrelated to the original
	  conclusion
