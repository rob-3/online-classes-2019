# Truth Tables
- Arrangement of truth values that helps us to determine the value of a compound
  proposition in terms of its simple components
- We can then determine if a compound argument is valid or invalid

## How to make
- Make a column for each simple statement
- Make a column for each complex proposition that we are interested in
- Make a row for each possible combination of truth values (2^n, where n = # of
  simple statements)

## The tree method
- Form a tree beginning with one simple statement and extends 2 branches on each
  branch with each T/F possibility for each other simple statement
- This can get very long/annoying with many simple statements

## The halving method
- Run the calculation 2^n, where n is the number of simple statements
- Divide this in half and put that many T's and then that many F's
- Then divide in half again and alternate over that amount in the next column
- Rinse and repeat as necessary

## Solving
- Fill in all values, box the column of letters under the main operator

# Classifying statements in truth tables
- Tautology: always true, regardless of simple components
- Contradiction: always false, regardless of simple components
- Contingent statement: could be true or false based on the simple components

# Using a truth table to compare two statements
- Logically equivalent statements: are the same down the entire column
- Contradictory statements: are opposites down the entire column
- Consistent statements: can be true at the same time
- Inconsistent statements: cannot be true at the same time
